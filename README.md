[This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automobile dataset containing various car attributes and their respective prices. The dataset consists of 205 car models, each with 26 features such as engine size, fuel type, horsepower, and price.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

symboling: Risk factor of the car (integer)

normalized-losses: Representing missing values with '?'

make: Car brand (categorical)

fuel-type: Type of fuel used (categorical)

aspiration: Aspiration type (categorical)

num-of-doors: Number of doors (categorical)

body-style: Type of body style (categorical)

drive-wheels: Type of drive wheels (categorical)

engine-location: Location of engine (categorical)

wheel-base: Wheelbase length (float)

length: Car length (float)

width: Car width (float)

height: Car height (float)

curb-weight: Weight of the car (int)

engine-type: Type of engine (categorical)

num-of-cylinders: Number of cylinders (categorical)

engine-size: Engine size (int)

fuel-system: Fuel system type (categorical)

bore: Bore diameter (object, needs conversion)

stroke: Stroke length (object, needs conversion)

compression-ratio: Compression ratio (float)

horsepower: Horsepower of the car (object, needs conversion)

peak-rpm: Peak RPM (object, needs conversion)

city-mpg: City miles per gallon (int)

highway-mpg: Highway miles per gallon (int)

price: Price of the car (object, needs conversion)

Insights and Key Findings
Data Types and Conversion: The dataset contains both categorical and numerical columns. Several columns (normalized-losses, horsepower, price, etc.) are stored as strings and need conversion to numeric values for analysis.

Missing Values: '?' represents missing values in some columns. These missing values will be handled either by imputation or removal.

Price Distribution: The target variable, price, is categorical and needs to be converted into a numeric format for regression or analysis purposes.

Feature Engineering: Some columns like bore, stroke, horsepower, and peak-rpm are objects that need type conversion, and some features might require encoding (e.g., fuel-type, body-style).

Libraries and Tools Used
pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations and handling missing values.

matplotlib & seaborn: For visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations in the data.

scikit-learn: (If used) For machine learning models and data splitting.

Preprocessing Steps
The following preprocessing steps are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

Handling Missing Data: Replace '?' with NaN and either fill or drop missing values.

Data Type Conversion: Convert columns like normalized-losses, horsepower, and price to numeric values.

Feature Encoding: Convert categorical columns to numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers in numerical columns.

Scaling/Normalization: Standardize numerical features if necessary for models or visualizations.

Visualizations and Analysis
The notebook uses matplotlib and seaborn for various visualizations:

Distribution of car prices and key features.

Correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.

Boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots for data exploration.
